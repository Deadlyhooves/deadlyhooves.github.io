				<p>
		        	My Name is Dylan Brown<br>
					I am 20 years old, and seeking to become a Software Engineer.<br>
					I work on video games, build sites, and have been a self-taught programmer since I was 8.
		        </p>
				
				<p>
					Each week I spend inbetween 10-20 hours of my own time (outside of work) putting together sites and developing games.
					 All of it leading to the simple goal of wanting to become a Junior Software Engineer at a company.
					 I have self-taught C++, C, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, LUA, and MANY other languages over the years, and hope to continue growing my skills further.<br>
